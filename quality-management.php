                    <p class="mt-3 text-justify">The stability and reliability of an asphalt mixing plant has a significant impact on the progress and final quality of a road construction or maintenance project. We strive to develop and sell premium quality products that will meet the expectations of our customers. We source many of our raw materials, components and parts from international suppliers with well-known brand names to enhance the reliability of our products. We have implemented strict quality control systems for our products. We have a quality control department and an inter-department quality control system to oversee the overall quality of our products and services. We employ standardised work processes and comprehensive quality control systems throughout our supply chain and manufacturing process. This allows us to quickly detect any quality issues thereby minimising any associated costs. Our stringent quality control practices are evidenced by the domestic and international certifications we received. For example, we have obtained the ISO9001:2008 Quality Management System certification and the OHSAS18001:2007 Occupational Safety and Health Management System certification. In addition, we have obtained the CE mark in 2009 which indicates that our products are in compliance with the E.U. safety, health and environmental protection requirements and are eligible to be sold in the market in the European Economic Area. Our products have obtained similar conformity certification for goods in Australia. According to the report on the asphalt mixing plant manufacturing industry in the PRC prepared by the CCID Consulting Company Limited, a professional market research and consulting firm commissioned by the Company, we were the first and one of the few asphalt mixing plant manufactures in the PRC that have acquired the CE mark, a certfication which is recognised worldwide.</p>
